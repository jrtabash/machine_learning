# Experiments in Machine Learning

## Wine Quality

Applying Support Vector Machines to classify the quality of a wine (good vs bad).

Using a wine quality data set, relating 11 physicochemical properties to the quality of the wine.

The wine quality data is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at the following link:

## Pulsar Star

Applying supervised classification to perdict a pulsar star.

Using a pulsar data set, where each pulsar candidate (row) is described using 8 attributes and a classification; 0 = Not Pulsar and 1 = Pulsar.

The pulsar star data is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at the following link:

## Dow Jones Index

Applying timeseries analysis and regression to predict the percentage change in stock price in the following week.

Using Dow Jones Index data, where each row consists of weekly stock data, including date, stock volume, open/close/high/low prices, percent change in price, percent change in next week's price, as well as several other attributes.

The Dow Jones Index data is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at the following link:

## Metro Traffic

Applying data cleaning techniques, data analysis, random forests, and Neural Networks to predict traffic volume intensity.

Using hourly Minneapolis-St Paul, MN traffic volume for westbound I-94 from 2012 until 2018. Data includes weather and holiday features.
