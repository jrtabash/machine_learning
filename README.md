## Pulsar Star

Applying supervised classification to perdict a pulsar star.

Using a pulsar data set, where each pulsar candidate (row) is described using 8 attributes and a classification; 0 = Not Pulsar and 1 = Pulsar.

The pulsar star data is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at the following link:

## Dow Jones Index

Applying timeseries analysis and regression to predict the percentage change in stock price in the following week.

Using Dow Jones Index data, where each row consists of weekly stock data, including date, stock volume, open/close/high/low prices, percent change in price, percent change in next week's price, as well as several other attributes.
